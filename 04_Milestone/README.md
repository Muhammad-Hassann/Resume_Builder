# Hackathon Project - Milestone 4: # Editable Resume Builder

## Project Overview

I update the milestone 3 and add edit feature in it. This project allows users to create, edit, and manage their resume dynamically with a sleek, dark-themed interface. The latest update includes an editing feature for easy modifications.

## Features

**Editable Sections**: Hover over any section (personal info, summary, skills, experience, education) to see the "Edit" button, allowing real-time updates via pre-filled forms.
**Profile Picture Upload**: Upload and preview a profile picture instantly.
**Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes using media queries.
**Dark Theme**: Sleek, modern dark-themed resume layout.
**Real-Time Preview**: Live updates are instantly reflected in the resume preview.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the resume and form inputs.
- **TypeScript**: Dynamic functionality and form handling.
- **Media Queries**: For responsive design, making the layout adapt to different screen sizes.
