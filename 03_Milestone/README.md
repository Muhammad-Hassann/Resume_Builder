# Hackathon Project - Milestone 3: # Dynamic Resume Builder

## Project Overview

Users can input their personal information, upload a profile picture, list their skills, experience, education, and instantly preview changes on the resume. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, providing a clean and responsive UI. Users can also add multiple entries for experience and education sections and toggle the visibility of different sections in the resume.
