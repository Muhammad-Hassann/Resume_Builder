# **Hackathon Project - Milestone 5: Unique Path and Shareable Link**

## **Project Overview**

This project is an **Interactive Resume Builder** using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It is a milestone-based hackathon project, and this is the last milestone. In this milestone, I added the functionality to download the resume and create a unique link with the username. The link isn't functional yet because it requires a backend and database.

## **New Features in Milestone 5**

- **Unique Path and Shareable Link**: Users can generate a unique URL based on their name. The link format is set up, but without a backend, it's not fully functional.
- **Resume Download**: Users can download their resumes in PDF or other formats.
- **Editable Sections**: Hover over any section (personal info, summary, skills, experience, education) to reveal an "Edit" button, enabling real-time updates via forms.

## **Features**

- **Profile Picture Upload**: Users can upload and preview a profile picture.
- **Dynamic Content**: All sections of the resume (personal info, skills, experience, and education) can be updated in real time using forms.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Dark Theme**: The resume has a modern dark-themed design.
- **Live Preview**: Changes made via the forms are instantly reflected in the resume preview.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: For the structure and layout of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the resume and form inputs.
- **TypeScript**: For dynamic functionality and form handling.
- **GSAP**: For animations and transitions.
- **Media Queries**: For responsive design to adapt to different screen sizes.
